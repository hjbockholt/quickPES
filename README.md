# QuickPES

A utility tool to simplify the organization and transfer of `.pes` files for Brother embroidery systems.

## Why QuickPES?

Users of the Brother embroidery hardware system sometimes struggle with sourcing various file formats that are compatible with particular types of embroidery units. One particular type, the `.pes` file, is a widely used format. However, because this format may be intermixed with many other types, it can be cumbersome for novice users to load these files onto a USB drive and keep them organized for transfer to the embroidery unit. `QuickPES` is designed to assist users in this endeavor, providing a streamlined interface and process to ensure seamless transfers and organization.

## Features

- Intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
- Ability to select and filter `.pes` files recursively from folders.
- Efficient organization and transfer of `.pes` files to a USB drive.
- Customizable subfolder naming for better organization.
